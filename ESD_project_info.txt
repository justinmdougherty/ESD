FILES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT TREE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
config_memory.c/h - interface to the memory map of device configurable
  operational/algorithmic parameters stored in non-volatile memory.

configuration_bits.c - Contains device configuration bit macros.  Refer to
the comments in configuration_bits.c for instructions on where to get
information about device configuration bits and their corresponding macros.

coords.c/h - convert from lat/lon to MGRS geographic coordinate systems

crc.c/h - driver functions for PIC24FJ128GA20x CRC peripheral.

esd_ver.h - Defines the string value of the ESD firmware version

fonts.c/h - Define various font widths, heights, and size in bytes; declare the
  various constant font values to be used with the UC1701X LCD display.

geofence.c/h - check to see if a geo point is within a geozone

i2c2.c/h - driver for the PIC24FJ128GA202's I2C2 module in a polled mode reading
  and writing individual bytes (i.e. doesn't use data queues)

interrupts.c - This file contains the default ISR for interrupts. The user would
  put the interrupt vectors for their application in the modules that implement
  the peripheral that generates the IRQ.

keypad.c/h - driver for hand-held 4-button keypad; periodic input scans and wake
  hand-held from PWR OFF.

lcd.c/h - interface to write font strings to UC1701X LCD display of hand-held

ltc2943.c/h - interface to LTC2943 columb counter IC and defines used to
  implement battery gas gauge functionality.

main.c/h - top level (main) attributes and methods required to implement user
  interface (aka ESD) of NSWCDD's Lightning BOLT hand-held.

mc24aa512.h - driver functions for Microchip EEPROM 24AA512.
mc24aa512_i2c2.c - driver functions using uC's i2c2 for Microchip EEPROM 24AA512

micro_defs.h - microcontroller pin useage/definitions, plethora of system stuff,
  how uC peripherals are assigned, etc.

queue.c/h - Generic circular queue.

stdint_extended.h - Defines, typedefs, and unions to extend stdint.h

tmr2.c/h - PIC24 16-bit synchronous TIMER2 driver.

traps.c - Define ISRs for traps and _DefaultInterrupt.  Code for traps results
  a software reset of the microcontroller.  If the code in this file
  is entered, that means there is a critical hardware problem or software bug.
  The trap will need evaluated by the user to determine the source
  of the problem.  www.microchip.com/codeexamples contains trap example code
  which can be used as a reference to help debug traps.

uart.h - Declare few things common to my queue based PIC UART drivers

uart1_queued.c/h - interface to IRQ driven 19200/8/N/1 implementation of UART1
  for reading data into a queue (can trigger a flag when a #defined value rcvd)
  and writing data from a queue (automatically stopping when queue emptied).

uc1701x.c/h - driver for the EA DOGS102W-6 UC1701 LCD display using the SPI1
  module on the PIC24FJ128GA202.

    CTC or NIWC and expose Lightning to COMx as is typical).  This is in prep
    for CATAMOUNT waveform which NIWC will need to squirt into BOLTs.

  Code baseline for CH certification with BOLT rev 4.1, NSWCPC antenna, 5mm
  board stack, and grey u.fl (should carry-over BOLT 4.0 and Ball antenna)
  1 Changes to implement and make use of new "waveform information" interface
    messages. This effort is to get away from wf load-out specific fw versions
    that depend on changing bt_waveform_load.h.
    Know that the LBHH will be of little use prior to receiving the suite of
    C.WFI messages via COMx to inform it of the waveforms in all slots.
  2 Delete bt_waveform_load.h, moving some things, e.g. BOOT_MUTE, to
    bt_waveform_traits.h for use in both ESD and Lightning.
  3 Add conditional compilation on ALLOW_HDN_INPUT ?defined? in keypad.h as part
    of removing hidden ADMIN menus since users have had time to learn unhidden
    admin menus.  Related - refactor KEYPAD_SCANCODE_ADM to KEYPAD_SCANCODE_HDN
  4 Get updated crc.c/h code from Lightning, which protects against bad address,
    typdefs crc_t and defines CRC_SIZE.  Make use of those.
  5 Modify bt_waveform_load.h and main.h to use define BUILDING_ESD
  6 Delete files from folder that in 1.3.1.9 were removed from project
  7 Modify EXFIL WAVEFORM screen to also display TX ID
  8 When invalid waveform selected modify screen flow & do not allow 911
    but do allow ZEROIZE

  1 Build of 20 units using different waveforms and hidden menus.
    Supports WFs: (1)Lynx-6; (2)Lynx-8; (3)AdvLynx-6; (4)AdvLynx-8
    Move beyond use of LYNX_6, LYNX_8, and FOG defines, but still have no way
    to query BOLT for waveform load-out so depend on bt_waveform_load.h, et al.
  2 Improve code readability/maintainability by making procedures to reduce size
    of some unwieldy switch statements
  3 Do more auto-correcting of brevity code entry as user goes along
  4 Use S.GKN ltng query/response for building admin UpdateInfilOptDisplay

  trying to write NVMEM after closing I2C2 when going to sleep.  Left justify
  MGRS text and add space between GZD and 100km Square ID.  Make coord and aof
  track each other (set aof = 0 when get D.GLL instead of D.TGF) so coord cant
  get stuck in inverse video.  Lower keypad entry time from 5 to 2 seconds.
  Rework esd_t so .hwF only 8-bits and BIT results only needs 2 hex digits by
  doing away with invalid bits, some of which used for other purposes.  Do BIT
  of TMR2 and TMR3. have uc1701 set .spi if appropriate.

1.1.1.8/170331 (2017/03/31) Rob Kirby             XC16 v1.24
  Basically a complete re-write as the original implementation, based on the
  paradigm used in BT7HH, was not scaling well to new capabilites.
  Added MGRS and MUTE; plus re-enable Duty Cycle and Transmit Power.
